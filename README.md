Challenge 14: Machine-Learning-Trading-Bot

The premise of this challenge is that I am a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. My firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, my firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave my firm a competitive advantage early on. However, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. I am thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain my firm's competitive advantage in the market. To do so, I will enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
